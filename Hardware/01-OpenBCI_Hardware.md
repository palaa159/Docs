# OpenBCI Hardware 

Welcome to the OpenBCI Hardware documentation page. Here you will find specifications of the OpenBCI suite of devices.  

## [Cyton](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/02-Cyton)

The [Cyton page](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/02-Cyton) covers the hardware specs of our 8 channel board and Dongle, as well as our expansion Daisy Module. ALL boards, shields, and dongles ship preflashed and programmed, ready to use out of the box!
For hackers, we've included resources as well.

The [Cyton Data Format](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/03-Cyton_Data_Format) page has all the information about how we package up the raw sensor data and send it wirelessly to the OpenBCI Dongle. There are two tutorials on how to [upload your custom code to the Cyton](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/05-Cyton_Board_Programming_Tutorial), and also how to [reprogram the Cyton Radio Modules](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/06-Cyton_Radios_Programming_Tutorial)

## [Ganglion](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/07-Ganglion)

The [Ganglion page](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/07-Ganglion) covers the specs of our 4 channel biosensing platform. 
The [Ganglion Data Format](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/08-Ganglion_Data_Format) page explains how we compress the raw Ganglion data and send it to a computer or phone or tablet via Bluetooth. The [Ganglion Programming Tutorial](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/09-Ganglion_Programming_Tutorial) page will walk you through how to modify the Ganglion firmware, and upload it Over The Air (OTA) using your smartphone!

## [Wifi Shield](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/12-Wifi_Programming_Tutorial)

The [Wifi Shield Page](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/12-Wifi_Programming_Tutorial) will guide you through reprogramming the tutorials and the [Wifi Shield Specs](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/11-Wifi) details the schematics. This board will allow data to be streamed up to 10 times faster than with bluetooth! Like all OpenBCI Boards, it comes fully programmed and ready to be [set up](http://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/03-Wifi_Getting_Started_Guide#wifi-getting-started-guide-connecting-with-the-openbci-gui).

Enjoy!
