# OpenBCI 8bit Board (no longer in production)

### 8bit Board Specs:

 * Power with 6-12V DC Battery ONLY
 * ATmega328P Micrcontroller with Arduino UNO bootloader
 * ADS1299 Analog Front End 
 * LIS3DH 3 axis Accelerometer 
 * RFduino BLE radio 
 * Micro SD card slot
 * Voltage Regulation (5V, 3V, +2.5V, -2.5V)
 * SN74LVCC3245A Level Shifter
 * Board Dimensions 2.41" x 2.41" (octogon has 1" edges)
 * Mount holes are 1/16" ID, 0.8" x 2.166" on center
 

### Breakout pins:
 
 * ICSP pins on 5V side for bootloading ATmega 
 	* MISO, MOSI, SCLK, 5V, MCLR, GND
 * Serial pins for programming RFduino
 	* RFTX, RFRX, RFRST, GND
 * SPI bus pins on the 3V side for Daisy Module expansion
 	* DVDD, GND, MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS, CLK, RST
 * Unused ATmega pins
 	* A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7
 	
The SPI bus pins on 3V side include CLK, which is tied to the ADS1299 CLK pin for timing the Daisy Module, and a RST pin which is tied to the ADS1299 MCLR pin for hardware reset of the ADS. The A0 to A5 pins can be used as Analog inputs or Digital Input|Output just like on Arduino UNO. A6 and A7 are Analog input only.

### Push Button
Pushbutton switch is RESET for ATmega. 

### Slide Switch
Slide switch is power for the board. The slide switch has three positions:

* BLE activates a pull-up on RFduino pin 4
* OFF disconnects the battery input 
* PC does NOT activate pull-up on RFduino pin 4

    **NOTE: BLE|PC selection is NOT implemented!**

Swtiching either BLE or PC will produce the same result. The option is available for future development...
