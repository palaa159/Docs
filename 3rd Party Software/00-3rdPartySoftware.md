# 3rd Party Software

Welcome to the **3rd Party Software** section! Here you will find guides to help you better undertand external software tools that the OpenBCI platform easily interfaces with. There are a number of great signal processing and data analysis platforms out there that greatly extend the powers and capabilities of OpenBCI hardware and software. We hope to interface OpenBCI with all of them!

If you are a developer of a 3rd Party Software platform that would work well with OpenBCI hardware, please [don't hesitate to reach out](mailto:contact@openbci.com). If most cases, we'll help provide technical assistance in the creation of drivers and data bridges between platforms. 

As of right now, we have tutorials for connecting OpenBCI to the following software tools:

* [MATLAB](http://docs.openbci.com/3rd%20Party%20Software/01-Matlab)
* [Neuromore](http://docs.openbci.com/3rd%20Party%20Software/02-Neuromore)
* [OpenViBE](http://docs.openbci.com/3rd%20Party%20Software/03-OpenViBE)
* [LabStreamingLayer](http://docs.openbci.com/3rd%20Party%20Software/04-LSL)
* [BrainBay](http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/)
