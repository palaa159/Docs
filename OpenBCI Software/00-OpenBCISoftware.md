# OpenBCI Software

Welcome to the **OpenBCI Software** section! Here you will find guides to help you better undertand the OpenBCI software and code. This section includes information about firmware (the code we upload to the boards), in addition to information about the PC-based software we develop. If you are interested in connecting your OpenBCI hardware to 3rd-Party software tools, head over to the [3rd-Party Software section](http://docs.openbci.com/3rd%20Party%20Software) of the docs. If you run into technical questions while working with any OpenBCI software, head over to the [Software section](http://openbci.com/index.php/forum/#/categories/software) of the OpenBCI Forum.
