# OpenBCI Electron Hub

Middleware Software used to communicate with OpenBCI boards through TCP/IP command protocol. This Doc covers the OpenBCI Hub for Cyton, Ganglion, and WiFi Shield.

## Version
Version `v2.0.0` released September 2017

Version `v1.0.0` released January 3rd, 2017.

## OpenBCI Electron Hub Overview
The OpenBCI Electron Hub (or just "Hub") is a TCP/IP server that listens for clients on port `10996` on `localhost` aka `127.0.0.1`. Broadcast/multicast is never used for transmitting information to clients. Outgoing data is only transmitted to the requesting client. We use [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org) the protocol is always listed first and foremost in all documentation. Please follow the rules of [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org) to avoid breaking changes.

The hub is designed for either two use cases:

1. An owning application, such as OpenBCI's processing app, starts and stops the Hub.
2. The Hub runs continuously and 3rd party applications can simply connect as clients, use OpenBCI boards, disconnect and go on their way without closing the Hub.

A unique port, `10996`, is critical because applications must be able to hit a known port number on a local machine. This Specification shall [be available here](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Electron/blob/master/ganglion-api-spec.yaml) in the [source code of the Hub](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Electron).

## Hub Command Protocol Overview

The Hub uses a comma-separated-value system followed by stop characters. The stop characters are `,;\n` or ("comma" "semi-colon" "backslash n"). A recommended client parsing is to store incoming TCP data into a buffer until the stop characters `';\n` are consecutively identified. The contents of the buffer can be now be considered a Message. The buffer can be flushed and the Message can be processed. Split the Message by `,` ("comma") to facilitate parsing. The first value will always be the command. The rest of the Message will then be translated based on the protocol for that command described in the Specification below. All commands sent to the client will be replied to asynchronously.

### Example:
If a client sends `s,start,;\n` to the Hub on `127.0.0.1:10996`, the Hub will respond with either `s,200,start,;\n` if the scan was started or an error message if unable to start such as `s,412,unable to start scan,;\n`.

## Command Set
Commands are sent from the client to the Hub. Each command gets an asynchronous response with a meaningful code. When able, errors are sent with string error messages.

### Channel Settings
**r,ACTION,(ARGS)**

For setting the channel settings on a Cyton board with either WiFi or Serial protocols set.

Availability: as of `v2.0.0`

#### ACTION - START

`start`

Used to start a channel setting sync. This will emit channel settings on success.

Availability: as of `v2.0.0`

Example: `r,start,;\n`

Response: on success for each channel, see the [Response Set](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/07-OpenBCI_Hub#openbci-electron-hub-response-set) below for _Channel Settings_.
