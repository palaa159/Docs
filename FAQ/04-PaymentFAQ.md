## When will my credit card be charged?

Our store system will authorize your card the moment you place your order and a settlement (debit) will likely occur within 48 hours.

## International Orders

Orders ship 2 business days after payment is processed. Orders take about one week to reach customs. Please note that our product price and shipping cost does not include customs clearance, import taxes, or duties. Customs authorities of your country will inform you of these fees when the order reaches customs. These can run up about 25% of the order value. The tracking number will be sent to your email for you to check on the shipping progress. For a customs estimate or any other ordering questions, email sales@openbci.com.
