**Research Published With OpenBCI**

We put together [The OpenBCI Citation List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WvolD2-QJ5aUJy5o0Dq5wdFQtLMkMtppZT8s_ihYyA4/edit#gid=0), a collection of recently published peer-reviewed research using OpenBCI products. 
For even more OpenBCI-based independent research, search for "openbci" in [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com). We're proud of how many OpenBCI-based research reports are out there!
